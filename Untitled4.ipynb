              "\"turns out fifty four dollars and twenty cents was not a joke from american public media this is market for in los angeles i'm car rest are monday to their do believe the twenty fifth of april get as always be a long everybody are i just for fun i am going to see if i can do this in two hundred and eighty characters which is of course twitters limit starting right now after making a not very veiled marijuana reference in offering fifty four dollars twenty cents a share to buy twitter elon musk has sealed the deal as of today lauren hirsch has been covering the story for the new york times thanks for coming on thanks for having me setting aside all marijuana jokes that many people paid with this price that most offered clearly he was serious and now this has happened in an unbelievably fast timeline rain unbelievably fast at how you i was at a shower yesterday communicating with the store it's kind of casually checking and and my source cause i think there could be it the other morale and hang out what how is that even possible and in don't i think both people never that a deal would have happened and even if people thought they were a be a deal i don't think anyone thought it couldn't possibly happen this quickly he gets all the money together they have these board meetings over the weekend and then today it's a done deal let me ask you this though and this may be a longer answer than we have time for in the program today why does elon musk wanna buy where i can tell you what he has said which is he is he would call himself and advocate for free speech and he doesn't like the way that and twitter has managed clinton on it's platform and he wants to change that he's working if they even today about our kind of decentralizing of content with effectively allowing users to personalize their content that they see on the app but i'll tell you a lot of people really don't know that is what he said but they're feel they there might be something deeper here you know to spend forty billion dollar is largely am of his on money wrote i notice you didn't say he wants to make money he wants to run it as a better business and show the the the the logical extension of that is your you have a an american oligarch buying a global communications platform and were a mortgage it's going to have to see what happens were just gonna have to see what happened i don't think we have really ever seen anything like that scene obviously their favor of by either one would impose but that was very different he said he would not get involved at all editorially in iraq last calcite in editorial concerned is his desire in buying it for now that we don't really know what that end goal live here and he said on his ted talk of the day in around at random he announced his bed their profit is not a motive so it'll be interesting to see how this turns out it will indeed to to the nuts and bolts of this negotiation the he comes in and says i want to buy twitter and here's my price final offer the board says and are know there's talk about a poison pill the boards clearly not excited and then presto change though the board says yes did they just give up and say you know what we don't have a better way to run this thing you do it the big prize their change or with him putting together financing many people thought he would never be able to do it but on wednesday and thursday or he made public that he had actually called together i think more than the and von for ended up being so that changed the game for the board olive the fat and they had to take the offer seriously and the pressure with mounting shareholder of recalling an editor and point you have to listen to your shareholder than they seem to be indicating they wanted to go with ilan feel so thing and then i'll let you go because i know you got reporting to do on this your on twitter i'm on twitter lots of people we both know or on twitter journalist so and many others but the overwhelming majority of the american public isn't why do we care about this that's an excellent question i think it goes to what we were discussing earlier in the power of well certainly in our country to effective we get pretty much anything you want i don't think anyone thought that twitter west and fights but the fact that he the richest person in the country maintain a what our vs go in and are not either yes or no richest person in the world makes it so and on that you know either journalists the you kind of have this and very idealistic view and communications and media how it should be ryan in this really has taken the rug out from under that because this is a man with a clear view and he's going around that with a clear view it and i think we all need to rethink their ramifications on communication in a country lord hirsch covers business and most recently the twitter story new almost for the new york times or thanks a lot of pressure jitter thanks for having me that introduction by the way to hundred and forty five characters nailed it it's twitter shares on this monday up almost six percent still though a couple about shy of must offer of once again fifty four dollars twenty cents bees elsewhere major indices were up where the details when we do the numbers are marked janitors for friday everybody that's when the latest inflation numbers are going to be out we told you about the march consumer price index couple of weeks ago of eight and a half percent year on year as your surely know by now this friday we get p c e that personal consumption expenditures which the federal reserve really likes but as we all know everybody is watching inflation right now there are those some nuances in the way that people experience inflation that the official metrics just don't capture so i think maybe he could be helpful to like tell a story to sorta indecisive why the reasons that i decided to study this topic and i thought it was interesting i'm sorry you are yeah i wouldn't do to board should sort of phd candidate you see city ago and actually just finishing up my phd and so then after that our the doctor ordered but until then and stores you are i will then future doctor orchard please go on and twenty eleven or build doug the who was the president of a new york fed at the time he was doing an average speech to a blue collar community in in new york and other the reason for the speeches people were concerned about cost of living just like they are today but unlike today the actual official measure of inflation wasn't that high back then some prices food and energy of course we're going up a lot of the prices not really so much the cp i the consumer price index was up two point seven percent year over year when bill dudley give that speech eight and a half percent day as we all know and it as an example of why the fed wasn't super concerned about inflation give an example of you know if you look at the i pad to which had just come out it's the same price as i've had one is better introductory course of an i pad one four hundred and ninety nine dollars introductory cost of an i pad to a year later for ninety nine dollars you know some prices are going down and then someone from the audience shouted are we can't eat and aipac fact check true and i think this goes to show that you don't maybe the prices of some things aren't that important for some people said the actual topic of my dissertation is how the price index for low income in high income households can systematically differ over the course of the business cycle in other words where you are on the income spectrum determines your personal inflation rate right now from march twenty twenty two of was last report that we got compared to march twenty twenty one inflation rate for low income households was running at about nine percent before high income households as much closer to the average inflation rate at eight and a half percent in other words inflation is high for everybody but there is a gap and if you step back for a second and think big picture economic sense the two biggest sources of inflation or energy prices and food that stephanie city know professor of economics at the university of vermont and for low income families they comprise a much larger portion of the budget so poor families are undoubtedly or hit hard and there is another piece of this we gotta talk about inflation and jobs the overall inflation rate is at a forty year high the overall unemployment rate three point six percent darn near fifty year lows but there is a huge carving out there latino unemployment rate four point two percent in march the black unemployment rate six point two percent i wanna be clear that when you ask people in a survey do they care more about unemployment or inflation they say unemployment they would rather live with some inflation and have a job that have low inflation and no job here's the thing though you can raise interest rates to fight inflation which the fed does that slows the economy and that usually increases unemployment we call it the sacrifice ratio and the sacrifice is disproportionately paid for by people of color that is african americans and hispanics are disproportionately likely to lose their jobs and your job which you can read as your wages right that affects what you buy which gets reflected in those inflation numbers we overall sleepy eye is meant to capture the spending patterns of a typical household but really nobody's the typical household and that gets us to this last point how we measure inflation in this economy then you'll circle is a professor wellesley also though he's the chair of a national academy of sciences committee that is studying ways to modernize the consumer price index make it better write more useful the bill as does polish a couple of versions of the cp i already but there's plenty of room for improvement like they could do what jacob orchard another researchers member jacob orchard the almost doctor up from the top to do what they do using so data on spending patterns to this aggregate the sepia a step further than that would be to develop a data system where they really could link prices of particular items to the demographic characteristics of the people buying them that would be kind of like the holy grail which would be super useful in the meanwhile they're waiting for the holy grail later on this week the feds favored inflation metric pc you will tell you why that is the one that they like one by one more quick thing on inflation and wages this time the national association for business economics is out the new survey of economists to work at big companies and those economist a record number of i'm say their businesses have been booked in pay increases of late year but here's marketplace and anti immortal against in leicester jones is world you need muscle we rely on a lot of all manual labor jones is chief economist at the national beer wholesalers association we move cases of beverages throughout the economy they're heavy his jokes and some distributors are competing fiercely for workers and it's like that all over seventy percent of the economists surveyed said wages rose at their companies that's the highest number in the surveys forty year history but then the most part employers aren't boosting wage is enough to keep up with soaring prices cornell labour economist erica gross and has a theory on that they don't want to get too far ahead of inflation because it's hard to dial that back some economists in their survey don't expect their firms to pay workers more in the future say over the next three months brad her spine a senior economist at the tub you eat up john institute for employment research says that's because employers expect inflation to moderate people think that a lot of the supply chain issues will gradually get resolved and that be worse situation in ukraine may also or then surely i die down earliest get partially resolved but in the meantime many workers will be stuck with raises they don't keep up with rising prices and her spine says inflation may not get back to normal levels until next year i'm nancy marshall cancer for marketplace on up you need to keep that stock up or someone will do it for you moron even first though

bottom line it's a good price and there were looking out she said for shareholders and that's the mature an american capitalism right maximizing shareholder value well yes and no i mean it is the mantra but how and why it came to be that way marketplaces got tongue looked into that for his back in two thousand and sixteen it all began with a professor at the university of chicago economist milton friedman wrote this in nineteen seventy there is one and only one social responsibility of business to increase it's profits for whom for stockholders he wrote this was a brand new idea that took because the old corporate model was crumbling under pressure from inflation and from weak growth rick workmen of the drucker institute is the author of the end of loyalty coming up this year some called it slump flexion or in flunk was another have circulated but most famously was stagflation it exposed american companies as uncompetitive many companies had gotten fat and lazy during the golden age of american business which didn't see the seem starting to come apart until the late sixties early seventies friedman and a chicago colleagues or give the companies were taking on too many social responsibilities providing jobs helping to fight pollution and and discrimination it was inefficient we saw enormous amounts of waste going on economists mike johnson was a student of friedman's and he call wrote the most cited business paper ever shareholders suffered he wrote because executives were selfish they wanted perks you can't ignore the self interested everybody that and ball in you can't assume that for homes maximize profits ceos feathering their nests now some of us have a certain vintage recall the eighties film wall street it stars a rather have noxious shareholder gordon gekko here talk and other shareholders and you are all being royally screwed over by these these bureaucrats with their their state life was their hunting and fishing trips their their corporate jets the golden parachutes if you listen closely gordon gekko was channeling his inner university of chicago mike jensen if you shape of executives shape up companies and shareholders when quite often something that significantly new and right or basically right is rejected by the profession because it's to new but that all went away eventually it caught off it stuck jensen went on to become a superstar prof at harvard business school where his ideas went mainstream david lang staff was named be a student then before going on to run companies in national defense the dominant in the accepted understanding at the time which continues is a business is there to make a profit for shareholders period so into the eighties echo chamber along with big hair and new coke went three business words maximize shareholder value my jensen mean how to use those words but that's how his ideas got applied by a whole generation of leaders says roger martin he's former management dean at the university of toronto there was an obsession with shareholder value maximisation as manifested in meeting your quarterly earnings for the analysts are all happy with you how happy stocks sword twelve for than the eighties and nineties for every one dollar and profits eighty cents when to shareholders through dividends and what to call buybacks which brings us to the rub a fast way to fast profits is cutting jobs records mean of the drucker institute says what began to erode at this time is what he calls the corporate social contract that basically said if you come to work every day and you work hard and you give the corporation a measure of loyalty we in turn will take care of you often for the rest of your life and all that change wages flattened pensions and health care benefits eroded this idea of maximizing shareholder value is an important reason why all that happened there are other reasons the rise of technology globalization the decline of unions but i'd put it right up there with any of those other factors to many the relevant case study here is general electric in the nineteen eighties run by an old college hockey captain named jack welch and g e in the fifties like many companies then made explicit that workers and research came first shareholders last but under welsh it sized more than a hundred thousand workers and five years one of his strategies been to dump the lowest ten percent of performers here's welsh at the mit sloan school of business in two thousand and five okay you know exactly who the turkey's up in a weatherman skill baseball teams do it every day it's the way it is why should this is not have cats welsh cut entire divisions and plants he famously demanded that is managers fix it sell it or close it a lot of people initially were a little bit of armed nicholas heyman of the investment bank william blair is a long long time g e analyst on all the way back to the eighties he spoke by phone geez action spawned a lot more similar type of aggressive cost restructuring across industrial america in the late eighties and throughout the nineties fair or not welsh became the face of maximizing shareholder value it's winners and it's losers in his two decades at the helm g he meant wallstreet expectations almost every single quarter a fourteen billion dollar company became a more than four hundred billion behemoth watch himself made nearly a billion dollars to other executives followed sometimes to be like him and sometimes out of fear because in the mid eighties and testy shareholders with deep pockets started a buyout be companies and fire under performing executives there's accountability one the dust this i'll took on different names from corporate raider is to today's activist investors perhaps the most famous being carl icahn hedge fund manager jeff graham has written a book on these battles it's called dear chairman if you're the ceo of a company than a you have to keep that stock up there is a famous quote from carl icahn are from the nineteen eighties you need to keep that stock up or someone will do it for you shareholders first it became gospel but the question is is that even in the scripture does the law require it cornell law professor lynn stout is the author of the shareholder value myth there is a widespread a hand completely erroneous belief out there that there's some sort of legal duty that corporate managers have to quote maximize profits or maximize shareholder value in stats view the misplaced assumption comes from an old old case that sites stock holders interest but to stay out of the weeds here she argues it did not set precedent by contrast you can just pick up the supreme court case hobby lobby decided just a few years ago read the majority opinion were justice alito says and i quote modern corporate law does not require for profit corporations to pursue profit at the expense of everything else know just to be clear law professor still argue about this but the point is it's far from a legal given that companies have to make profits for shareholders and yet it became the law the land and stout it led directly to some bad decisions and run the bp oil spill the financial crisis which brings us back to the man widely acclaimed as the intellectual father mike jensen is it happened exactly the way i wanted it happen the probably not jensen says the shareholder focus in some cases went overboard there's always gonna be some people who take it too far and then cause damage he says focusing only on stocks and stockholders is a misreading of his scholarship for the record he wrote in nineteen ninety that ceo should quote do what is in the shareholders best interest now he says i wouldn't put shareholders at the center i'm still unhappy about the situation where people end up thinking that shareholders or primary there are only bosses know still maximizing shareholder value remains in fashion in one study of the snp five hundred companies the sheriff profits going to stockholders has gone from fifty percent in the early eighties to eighty six percent in twenty third team leaving in ever shrinking pool of money to invest in the businesses themselves in washington and scott tom the marketplace his final note on the ad day an opportunity for you if you've got a spare five million or so dollars saw this in the wall street journal today back in the before times warren buffett auctioned off a steak lunch with him every year proceeds to charity and san francisco hasn't happened obviously since two thousand and nineteen and this year's launch we are told will be the last buffet is after all ninety one anyway bidding opens june the twelve the two thousand and nineteen launched just for some comparison went for four point six million americans millions of course you do get to bring seven friend or it's super quick moment of economic context a calendar reminder should you be so inclined elon musks new company twitter of course reports earnings on thursday our daily production team is unease i'm in any corbyn richard cunningham real on or mchenry and a policy years on car result we will see you tomorrow but this is apia turns out fifty four dollars and twenty cents was not a joke ah from american public media this is marty for in los angeles i'm car rest on monday to their do believe the twenty fifth of

car dollar and hers talked about why the twitter board took elon musks offer of fifty four twenty sure when we're talking of the of the show bottom line it's a good price and there were looking out she said for shareholders and that's the mature at american capitalism right maximizing shareholder value well yes and no i mean it is the mantra but how and why it came to be that way marketplaces got tongue looked into that for his back in two thousand and sixteen it all began with a professor at the university of chicago economist milton friedman wrote this in nineteen seventy there is one and only one social responsibility of business to increase it's profits for whom for stockholders he wrote this was a brand new idea that took because the old corporate model was crumbling under pressure from inflation and from weak growth records workman of the drucker institute is the author of the end of loyalty coming up this year some called it's slump flexion or in flunk was another one hundred circulated but most famously was stagflation it exposed american companies as uncompetitive many companies had gotten fat and lazy during the golden age of american business which didn't see the seem starting to come apart until the late sixties early seventies friedman any chicago colleagues or give the companies were taking on too many social responsibilities providing jobs helping to fight pollution and and discrimination it was inefficient we saw enormous amounts of waste going on economists mike johnson was a student of friedman's and he call wrote the most cited business paper ever shareholders suffered he wrote because executives were selfish they wanted perks you can't ignore the self interest of everybody that and ball in you can't assume that for homes maximize profits ceos feathering their nests now some of us have a certain vintage recall the eighties film wall street it stars or rather have noxious shareholder gordon gekko here talk and other shareholders you are all being royally screwed over by these these bureaucrats with their their state life was their hunting and fishing trips their their corporate jets the golden parachute if you listen closely gordon gekko was channeling his inner university of chicago mike jensen if you ship of executives shape up companies and shareholders when quite often something that significantly new and right or basically right is rejected by the profession because it's to new but that all went away eventually it caught off it stuck jensen went on to become a superstar profit harvard business school where his ideas went mainstream david lang staff was named be a student then before going on to run companies in national defense the dominant in the accepted understanding at the time which continues is a business is there to make a profit for shareholders period so into the eighties echo chamber along with big hair and new coke went three business words maximize shareholder value my jensen mean how to use those words but that's how his ideas got applied by a whole generation of leaders says roger martin he's former management dean at the university of toronto there was an obsession with shareholder value maximisation as manifested in meeting your quarterly earnings for the analysts are all happy with you how happy stocks sword twelve fooled in the eighties and nineties for every one dollar and profits eighty cents went to shareholders through dividends and what to call buybacks which brings us to the rub a fast way to fast profits is cutting jobs records mean of the drucker institute says what began to erode at this time is what he calls the corporate social contract that basically said if you come to work every day and you work hard and you give the corporation a measure of loyalty we in turn will take care of you often for the rest of your life and all that change wages flattened pensions and health care benefits eroded this idea of maximizing shareholder value is an important reason why all that happened there are other reasons the rise of technology globalization the decline of unions but i'd put it right up there with any of those other factors to many the relevant case study here is general electric in the nineteen eighties run by an old college hockey captain named jack welch and g e in the fifties like many companies then made explicit that workers and research came first shareholders last but under welsh it downsize more than a hundred thousand workers and five years when of a strategies being to dump the lowest ten percent of performers here's welsh at the mit sloan school of business in two thousand and five okay you know exactly who the turkey's off and there was a month skill baseball teams do it every day it's the way it is why should this is not have cats welsh cut entire divisions and plants he famously demanded that is managers fix it sell it or close it a lot of people initially were a little bit of armed nicholas heyman of the investment bank william blair is a long long time g e analyst on all the way back to the eighties he spoke by phone geez action spawned a lot more similar type of aggressive cost restructuring across industrial america in the late eighties and throughout the nineties fair or not welsh became the face of maximizing shareholder value it's winners and it's losers in his two decades at the helm g he meant wall street expectations almost every single quarter a fourteen billion dollar company became a more than four hundred billion behemoth welsh himself made nearly a billion dollars to other executives followed sometimes to be like him and sometimes out of fear because in the mid eighties and testy shareholders with deep pockets started a buyout be companies and fire under performing executives there's accountability one the dust miss i'll talk on different names from corporate raider is to today's activist investors perhaps the most famous being carl icahn hedge fund manager jeff graham has written a book on these battles it's called dear chairman if you're the ceo of accompany than a you have to keep that stock up there is a famous quote from carl icahn are from the nineteen eighties you need to keep that stock up or someone will do it for you shareholders first it became gospel but the question is is that even in the scripture does the law require it cornell law professor lynn stout is the author of the shareholder value myth there is a widespread hand completely erroneous belief out there that there's some sort of legal duty that corporate managers have to quote maximize profits or maximize shareholder value in stats view the misplaced assumption comes from an old old case that sites stock holders interest but to stay out of the weeds here she argues it did not set precedent by contrast you can just pick up the supreme court case hobby lobby decided just a few years ago read the majority opinion were justice alito says and i quote modern corporate law does not require for profit corporations to pursue profit at the expense of everything else you're just to be clear law professor still argue about this but the point is it's far from a legal given that companies have to make profits for shareholders and yet it became the law the land and stout it led directly to some bad decisions and run the bp oil spill the financial crisis which brings us back to the man widely acclaimed as the intellectual father mike jensen is it happened exactly the way i wanted it happen the probably not jensen says the shareholder focus in some cases went overboard there's always gonna be some people who take it too far and then cause damage he says focusing only on stocks and stockholders is a misreading of his scholarship for the record he wrote in nineteen ninety that ceo should quote do what is in the shareholders best interest now he says i wouldn't put shareholders at the center i'm still unhappy about that situation where people end up thinking that shareholders or primary there are only bosses know still maximizing shareholder value remains in fashion in one study of the snp five hundred companies the sheriff profits going to stockholders has gone from fifty percent in the early eighties to eighty six percent in twenty third team leaving and ever shrinking pool of money to invest in the businesses themselves in washington and scott tom the marketplace the final note on the ad day an opportunity for you if you've got a spare five million or so dollars saw this in the wall street journal today back in the before times warren buffett

              " 'text': \"turns out fifty four dollars and twenty cents was not a joke from american public media this is market for in los angeles i'm car rest are monday to their do believe the twenty fifth of april get as always be a long everybody are i just for fun i am going to see if i can do this in two hundred and eighty characters which is of course twitters limit starting right now after making a not very veiled marijuana reference in offering fifty four dollars twenty cents a share to buy twitter elon musk has sealed the deal as of today lauren hirsch has been covering the story for the new york times thanks for coming on thanks for having me setting aside all marijuana jokes that many people paid with this price that most offered clearly he was serious and now this has happened in an unbelievably fast timeline rain unbelievably fast at how you i was at a shower yesterday communicating with the store it's kind of casually checking and and my source cause i think there could be it the other morale and hang out what how is that even possible and in don't i think both people never that a deal would have happened and even if people thought they were a be a deal i don't think anyone thought it couldn't possibly happen this quickly he gets all the money together they have these board meetings over the weekend and then today it's a done deal let me ask you this though and this may be a longer answer than we have time for in the program today why does elon musk wanna buy where i can tell you what he has said which is he is he would call himself and advocate for free speech and he doesn't like the way that and twitter has managed clinton on it's platform and he wants to change that he's working if they even today about our kind of decentralizing of content with effectively allowing users to personalize their content that they see on the app but i'll tell you a lot of people really don't know that is what he said but they're feel they there might be something deeper here you know to spend forty billion dollar is largely am of his on money wrote i notice you didn't say he wants to make money he wants to run it as a better business and show the the the the logical extension of that is your you have a an american oligarch buying a global communications platform and were a mortgage it's going to have to see what happens were just gonna have to see what happened i don't think we have really ever seen anything like that scene obviously their favor of by either one would impose but that was very different he said he would not get involved at all editorially in iraq last calcite in editorial concerned is his desire in buying it for now that we don't really know what that end goal live here and he said on his ted talk of the day in around at random he announced his bed their profit is not a motive so it'll be interesting to see how this turns out it will indeed to to the nuts and bolts of this negotiation the he comes in and says i want to buy twitter and here's my price final offer the board says and are know there's talk about a poison pill the boards clearly not excited and then presto change though the board says yes did they just give up and say you know what we don't have a better way to run this thing you do it the big prize their change or with him putting together financing many people thought he would never be able to do it but on wednesday and thursday or he made public that he had actually called together i think more than the and von for ended up being so that changed the game for the board olive the fat and they had to take the offer seriously and the pressure with mounting shareholder of recalling an editor and point you have to listen to your shareholder than they seem to be indicating they wanted to go with ilan feel so thing and then i'll let you go because i know you got reporting to do on this your on twitter i'm on twitter lots of people we both know or on twitter journalist so and many others but the overwhelming majority of the american public isn't why do we care about this that's an excellent question i think it goes to what we were discussing earlier in the power of well certainly in our country to effective we get pretty much anything you want i don't think anyone thought that twitter west and fights but the fact that he the richest person in the country maintain a what our vs go in and are not either yes or no richest person in the world makes it so and on that you know either journalists the you kind of have this and very idealistic view and communications and media how it should be ryan in this really has taken the rug out from under that because this is a man with a clear view and he's going around that with a clear view it and i think we all need to rethink their ramifications on communication in a country lord hirsch covers business and most recently the twitter story new almost for the new york times or thanks a lot of pressure jitter thanks for having me that introduction by the way to hundred and forty five characters nailed it it's twitter shares on this monday up almost six percent still though a couple about shy of must offer of once again fifty four dollars twenty cents bees elsewhere major indices were up where the details when we do the numbers are marked janitors for friday everybody that's when the latest inflation numbers are going to be out we told you about the march consumer price index couple of weeks ago of eight and a half percent year on year as your surely know by now this friday we get p c e that personal consumption expenditures which the federal reserve really likes but as we all know everybody is watching inflation right now there are those some nuances in the way that people experience inflation that the official metrics just don't capture so i think maybe he could be helpful to like tell a story to sorta indecisive why the reasons that i decided to study this topic and i thought it was interesting i'm sorry you are yeah i wouldn't do to board should sort of phd candidate you see city ago and actually just finishing up my phd and so then after that our the doctor ordered but until then and stores you are i will then future doctor orchard please go on and twenty eleven or build doug the who was the president of a new york fed at the time he was doing an average speech to a blue collar community in in new york and other the reason for the speeches people were concerned about cost of living just like they are today but unlike today the actual official measure of inflation wasn't that high back then some prices food and energy of course we're going up a lot of the prices not really so much the cp i the consumer price index was up two point seven percent year over year when bill dudley give that speech eight and a half percent day as we all know and it as an example of why the fed wasn't super concerned about inflation give an example of you know if you look at the i pad to which had just come out it's the same price as i've had one is better introductory course of an i pad one four hundred and ninety nine dollars introductory cost of an i pad to a year later for ninety nine dollars you know some prices are going down and then someone from the audience shouted are we can't eat and aipac fact check true and i think this goes to show that you don't maybe the prices of some things aren't that important for some people said the actual topic of my dissertation is how the price index for low income in high income households can systematically differ over the course of the business cycle in other words where you are on the income spectrum determines your personal inflation rate right now from march twenty twenty two of was last report that we got compared to march twenty twenty one inflation rate for low income households was running at about nine percent before high income households as much closer to the average inflation rate at eight and a half percent in other words inflation is high for everybody but there is a gap and if you step back for a second and think big picture economic sense the two biggest sources of inflation or energy prices and food that stephanie city know professor of economics at the university of vermont and for low income families they comprise a much larger portion of the budget so poor families are undoubtedly or hit hard and there is another piece of this we gotta talk about inflation and jobs the overall inflation rate is at a forty year high the overall unemployment rate three point six percent darn near fifty year lows but there is a huge carving out there latino unemployment rate four point two percent in march the black unemployment rate six point two percent i wanna be clear that when you ask people in a survey do they care more about unemployment or inflation they say unemployment they would rather live with some inflation and have a job that have low inflation and no job here's the thing though you can raise interest rates to fight inflation which the fed does that slows the economy and that usually increases unemployment we call it the sacrifice ratio and the sacrifice is disproportionately paid for by people of color that is african americans and hispanics are disproportionately likely to lose their jobs and your job which you can read as your wages right that affects what you buy which gets reflected in those inflation numbers we overall sleepy eye is meant to capture the spending patterns of a typical household but really nobody's the typical household and that gets us to this last point how we measure inflation in this economy then you'll circle is a professor wellesley also though he's the chair of a national academy of sciences committee that is studying ways to modernize the consumer price index make it better write more useful the bill as does polish a couple of versions of the cp i already but there's plenty of room for improvement like they could do what jacob orchard another researchers member jacob orchard the almost doctor up from the top to do what they do using so data on spending patterns to this aggregate the sepia a step further than that would be to develop a data system where they really could link prices of particular items to the demographic characteristics of the people buying them that would be kind of like the holy grail which would be super useful in the meanwhile they're waiting for the holy grail later on this week the feds favored inflation metric pc you will tell you why that is the one that they like one by one more quick thing on inflation and wages this time the national association for business economics is out the new survey of economists to work at big companies and those economist a record number of i'm say their businesses have been booked in pay increases of late year but here's marketplace and anti immortal against in leicester jones is world you need muscle we rely on a lot of all manual labor jones is chief economist at the national beer wholesalers association we move cases of beverages throughout the economy they're heavy his jokes and some distributors are competing fiercely for workers and it's like that all over seventy percent of the economists surveyed said wages rose at their companies that's the highest number in the surveys forty year history but then the most part employers aren't boosting wage is enough to keep up with soaring prices cornell labour economist erica gross and has a theory on that they don't want to get too far ahead of inflation because it's hard to dial that back some economists in their survey don't expect their firms to pay workers more in the future say over the next three months brad her spine a senior economist at the tub you eat up john institute for employment research says that's because employers expect inflation to moderate people think that a lot of the supply chain issues will gradually get resolved and that be worse situation in ukraine may also or then surely i die down earliest get partially resolved but in the meantime many workers will be stuck with raises they don't keep up with rising prices and her spine says inflation may not get back to normal levels until next year i'm nancy marshall cancer for marketplace on up you need to keep that stock up or someone will do it for you moron even first though

bottom line it's a good price and there were looking out she said for shareholders and that's the mature an american capitalism right maximizing shareholder value well yes and no i mean it is the mantra but how and why it came to be that way marketplaces got tongue looked into that for his back in two thousand and sixteen it all began with a professor at the university of chicago economist milton friedman wrote this in nineteen seventy there is one and only one social responsibility of business to increase it's profits for whom for stockholders he wrote this was a brand new idea that took because the old corporate model was crumbling under pressure from inflation and from weak growth rick workmen of the drucker institute is the author of the end of loyalty coming up this year some called it slump flexion or in flunk was another have circulated but most famously was stagflation it exposed american companies as uncompetitive many companies had gotten fat and lazy during the golden age of american business which didn't see the seem starting to come apart until the late sixties early seventies friedman and a chicago colleagues or give the companies were taking on too many social responsibilities providing jobs helping to fight pollution and and discrimination it was inefficient we saw enormous amounts of waste going on economists mike johnson was a student of friedman's and he call wrote the most cited business paper ever shareholders suffered he wrote because executives were selfish they wanted perks you can't ignore the self interested everybody that and ball in you can't assume that for homes maximize profits ceos feathering their nests now some of us have a certain vintage recall the eighties film wall street it stars a rather have noxious shareholder gordon gekko here talk and other shareholders and you are all being royally screwed over by these these bureaucrats with their their state life was their hunting and fishing trips their their corporate jets the golden parachutes if you listen closely gordon gekko was channeling his inner university of chicago mike jensen if you shape of executives shape up companies and shareholders when quite often something that significantly new and right or basically right is rejected by the profession because it's to new but that all went away eventually it caught off it stuck jensen went on to become a superstar prof at harvard business school where his ideas went mainstream david lang staff was named be a student then before going on to run companies in national defense the dominant in the accepted understanding at the time which continues is a business is there to make a profit for shareholders period so into the eighties echo chamber along with big hair and new coke went three business words maximize shareholder value my jensen mean how to use those words but that's how his ideas got applied by a whole generation of leaders says roger martin he's former management dean at the university of toronto there was an obsession with shareholder value maximisation as manifested in meeting your quarterly earnings for the analysts are all happy with you how happy stocks sword twelve for than the eighties and nineties for every one dollar and profits eighty cents when to shareholders through dividends and what to call buybacks which brings us to the rub a fast way to fast profits is cutting jobs records mean of the drucker institute says what began to erode at this time is what he calls the corporate social contract that basically said if you come to work every day and you work hard and you give the corporation a measure of loyalty we in turn will take care of you often for the rest of your life and all that change wages flattened pensions and health care benefits eroded this idea of maximizing shareholder value is an important reason why all that happened there are other reasons the rise of technology globalization the decline of unions but i'd put it right up there with any of those other factors to many the relevant case study here is general electric in the nineteen eighties run by an old college hockey captain named jack welch and g e in the fifties like many companies then made explicit that workers and research came first shareholders last but under welsh it sized more than a hundred thousand workers and five years one of his strategies been to dump the lowest ten percent of performers here's welsh at the mit sloan school of business in two thousand and five okay you know exactly who the turkey's up in a weatherman skill baseball teams do it every day it's the way it is why should this is not have cats welsh cut entire divisions and plants he famously demanded that is managers fix it sell it or close it a lot of people initially were a little bit of armed nicholas heyman of the investment bank william blair is a long long time g e analyst on all the way back to the eighties he spoke by phone geez action spawned a lot more similar type of aggressive cost restructuring across industrial america in the late eighties and throughout the nineties fair or not welsh became the face of maximizing shareholder value it's winners and it's losers in his two decades at the helm g he meant wallstreet expectations almost every single quarter a fourteen billion dollar company became a more than four hundred billion behemoth watch himself made nearly a billion dollars to other executives followed sometimes to be like him and sometimes out of fear because in the mid eighties and testy shareholders with deep pockets started a buyout be companies and fire under performing executives there's accountability one the dust this i'll took on different names from corporate raider is to today's activist investors perhaps the most famous being carl icahn hedge fund manager jeff graham has written a book on these battles it's called dear chairman if you're the ceo of a company than a you have to keep that stock up there is a famous quote from carl icahn are from the nineteen eighties you need to keep that stock up or someone will do it for you shareholders first it became gospel but the question is is that even in the scripture does the law require it cornell law professor lynn stout is the author of the shareholder value myth there is a widespread a hand completely erroneous belief out there that there's some sort of legal duty that corporate managers have to quote maximize profits or maximize shareholder value in stats view the misplaced assumption comes from an old old case that sites stock holders interest but to stay out of the weeds here she argues it did not set precedent by contrast you can just pick up the supreme court case hobby lobby decided just a few years ago read the majority opinion were justice alito says and i quote modern corporate law does not require for profit corporations to pursue profit at the expense of everything else know just to be clear law professor still argue about this but the point is it's far from a legal given that companies have to make profits for shareholders and yet it became the law the land and stout it led directly to some bad decisions and run the bp oil spill the financial crisis which brings us back to the man widely acclaimed as the intellectual father mike jensen is it happened exactly the way i wanted it happen the probably not jensen says the shareholder focus in some cases went overboard there's always gonna be some people who take it too far and then cause damage he says focusing only on stocks and stockholders is a misreading of his scholarship for the record he wrote in nineteen ninety that ceo should quote do what is in the shareholders best interest now he says i wouldn't put shareholders at the center i'm still unhappy about the situation where people end up thinking that shareholders or primary there are only bosses know still maximizing shareholder value remains in fashion in one study of the snp five hundred companies the sheriff profits going to stockholders has gone from fifty percent in the early eighties to eighty six percent in twenty third team leaving in ever shrinking pool of money to invest in the businesses themselves in washington and scott tom the marketplace his final note on the ad day an opportunity for you if you've got a spare five million or so dollars saw this in the wall street journal today back in the before times warren buffett auctioned off a steak lunch with him every year proceeds to charity and san francisco hasn't happened obviously since two thousand and nineteen and this year's launch we are told will be the last buffet is after all ninety one anyway bidding opens june the twelve the two thousand and nineteen launched just for some comparison went for four point six million americans millions of course you do get to bring seven friend or it's super quick moment of economic context a calendar reminder should you be so inclined elon musks new company twitter of course reports earnings on thursday our daily production team is unease i'm in any corbyn richard cunningham real on or mchenry and a policy years on car result we will see you tomorrow but this is apia turns out fifty four dollars and twenty cents was not a joke ah from american public media this is marty for in los angeles i'm car rest on monday to their do believe the twenty fifth of april good as always be along everybody are i just for fun i am going to see if i can do this in two hundred and eighty characters which is of course twitters limit starting right now after making a not very veiled marijuana reference in offering fifty four dollars twenty cents a share to buy twitter you on musk has sealed the deal as of today lauren hirsch has been covering the story for the new york times thanks for coming on thanks for having me setting aside all marijuana jokes that many people paid with this price that most offered clearly he was serious and now this has happened in an unbelievably fast timeline rain unbelievably fast at how you i was at a shower yesterday communicating with the store it's kind of casually chatting and and my source cause i think there could be it the the morale and hang out what how is that even possible and in iowa i think both people never that a deal would have happened and even if people thought they weren't a be a deal i don't think anyone thought it couldn't possibly happen this quickly he gets all the money together they have these board meetings over the weekend and then today it's a done deal let me ask you this though and this may be a longer answer than we have time for in the program today why does elon musk wanna buy where i can tell you what he has said which is he is he would call himself and advocate for free speech and he doesn't like the way that and twitter has managed clinton on it's platform and he wants to change that he's in a statement today about our kind of the centralizing and content with effectively allowing users to personalize their content that they see on the app but i'll tell you a lot of people really don't know that is what he said that it feels like there might be something deeper here in our to spend forty billion dollar is largely am of his on money right i noticed you didn't say he wants to make money he wants to run it as a better business and show the the the the logical extension of that is here you have an american oligarch buying a global communications platform and were a mortgage it's going to have to see what happens were just gonna have to see what happened i don't think we have really ever seen anything like that thing obviously their favor of guy either one million dollars but that was very different he said he would not get involved at all editorially in iraq last calcite in editorial concerned is his desire in buying it for now that we don't really know what that and goal live here and he said on his can talk of the day around at random he announced his bed that profit is not a motive so it'll be interesting to see how this turns as it will indeed to to the nuts and bolts of this negotiation in the he comes in and says i want to buy twitter and here's my price final offer the board says and or know there's talk about a poison pill the boards clearly not excited and then presto change though the board says yes did they just give up and say you know what we don't have a better way to run this thing you do it the big prize don't change our with him putting together financing many people thought he would never be able to do and but on wednesday and thursday or he made publicly he had actually called together i think more than the advice for ended up being said that changed the game for the board all of the sudden they had it take the offer seriously and the pressure with mounting shareholder of recalling an edit certain point you have to listen to your shareholder than they seem to be indicating they wanted to go with you feel so last thing and then i'll let you go because i know you got reporting to do on this your on twitter i'm on twitter lots of people we both know or on twitter journalists and many others but the overwhelming majority of the american public isn't why do we care about this that's an excellent question i think it goes to what we were discussing earlier a in the power of well certainly in our country to effectively we get pretty much anything you want i don't think anyone thought that twitter with and fights but the fact that he of the richest person in the country maintain a what our research going into it or not either yes or no marriage is president the world makes it fell and on the you know either journalists you kind of have faith and very idealistic view and communications and media how it should be ryan in this really has taken the rug out from under that because this is a man with a clear view and he's going around that with at fairview it and i think we all need to rethink their ramifications on communication in a country lord hirsch covers business and most recently the twitter story new almost for the new york times or thanks a lot of pressure jitter thanks for having me that introduction by the way to hundred and forty five characters nailed it it's twitter shares on this monday up almost six percent still though a couple about shy of must offer of once again fifty four dollars twenty cents bees elsewhere major indices were up will have the details when we do the numbers are market calendars for friday everybody that's when the latest inflation numbers are going to be out we told you about the march consumer price index couple of weeks ago of eight and a half percent year on year as you're surely know by now this friday we get p c e that's personal consumption expenditures which the federal reserve really likes but as we all know everybody is watching inflation right now there are those some nuances in the way that people experience inflation that the official metrics just don't capture so i think maybe he could be helpful to like tell a story to sorta indecisive why the reasons that i decided to study this topic and i thought it was interesting i'm sorry you are yeah i and jacob orchard of phd candidate use he said he ago and actually just finishing up my phd and so then after that our the doctor ordered but until then i'm stores or i will then future doctor orchard please go on and twenty eleven or build dudley who was the president of a new york fed at the time he was doing an average speech to a blue collar community in in new york and other the reason for the speeches people were concerned about cost of living just like they are today but unlike today the actual official measure of inflation wasn't that high back then some prices food and energy of course we're going up a lot of the price prices not really so much the cp i the consumer price index was up two point seven percent year over year when bill dudley gave that speech eight and a half percent day as we all know and it as an example of why the fed wasn't super concerned about inflation give an example of you know if you look at the i pad to which had just come out it's the same price as i had one is better introductory course of an i pad one four hundred and ninety nine dollars introductory cost of an i pad to a year later for ninety nine dollars you know some prices are going down and then someone from the audience shouted are we can't eat and i that fact check true and i think this goes to show that you know maybe the prices up some things aren't that important for some people so the actual topic of my dissertation is how the price index for low income in high income households can systematically differ over the course of the business cycle in other words where you are on the income spectrum determines your personal inflation rate right now from march twenty twenty two so was last report that we got compared to march twenty twenty one inflation rate for low income households was running at about nine percent for high income households as much closer to the average inflation rate at a nap person in other words inflation is high for everybody but there is a gap and if you step back for a second and think big picture a kind of makes sense the two biggest sources of inflation or energy prices and food that's definitely no professor of economics at the university of vermont and for low income families they comprise a much larger portion of the budget so poor families are undoubtedly or hit hard and there is another piece of this we gotta talk about inflation and jobs the overall inflation rate is at a forty year high the overall unemployment rate three point six percent darn near fifty year lows but there is a huge carving out there latino unemployment rate four point two percent in march the black unemployment rate six point two percent i wanna be clear that when you ask people in a survey do they care more about unemployment or inflation they say unemployment they would rather live with some inflation and have a job that have low inflation and no job here's the thing though you can raise interest rates to fight inflation which the fed does that slows the economy and that usually increases unemployment we call it the sacrifice ratio and the sacrifice is disproportionately paid for by people of color that is african americans and hispanics are disproportionately likely to lose their jobs and your job which you can read as your wages right that affects what you buy which gets reflected in those inflation numbers the overall sleepy eye is meant to capture the spending patterns of a typical household but really nobody's the typical household and that gets us to this last point how we measure inflation in this economy then you'll circle is a professor wellesley also though he's the chair of a national academy of sciences committee that is studying ways to modernize the consumer price index make it better write more useful the bls does publish a couple of versions of the cp i already but there's plenty of room for improvement like they could do what jacob orchard and other researchers member jacob orchard the almost doctor up from the top could do what they do using so data on spending patterns to this aggregate the sepia a step further than that would be to develop a data system where they really could link prices of particular items to the demographic characteristics of the people buying them that would be kind of like a holy grail which would be super useful in the meanwhile they're waiting for the holy grail later on this week the feds favored inflation metric pc you will tell you why that is the one that they like one by one more quick thing on inflation and wages this done the national association for business economics is alvin the new survey of economists to work at big companies and those economist a record number of i'm say their businesses haven't booked in pay increases of late year but here's marketplace and as immortal cancer in leicester jones is world you need muscle we rely on a lot of our manual labor jones chief economist at the national beer wholesalers association we move cases of beverages throughout the economy they're heavy his jokes and some distributors are competing fiercely for workers and it's like that all over seventy percent of the economists surveyed said wages rose it their companies that's the highest number in the surveys forty year history but and the most part employers aren't boosting wage is enough to keep up with soaring prices cornell labour economist erica gross and has a theory on that they don't want to get too far ahead of inflation because it's hard to dial that back some economists in their survey don't expect their firms to pay workers more in the future say over the next three months brad her spine a senior economist at the tip you eat up john institute for employment research says that's because employers expect inflation to moderate people think that a lot of the supply chain issues will gradually get resolved and that be worse situation in ukraine may also or then surely die down or skip get partially resolved but in the meantime many workers will be stuck with raises they don't keep up with rising prices and her spine says inflation may not get back to normal levels until next year i'm nancy marshall cancer for marketplace german up you need to keep that stock up or someone will do it for you moron then first though let's do the numbers thou dost rose up to thirty eight today seven cents per cent thirty four thousand and forty nine and as that picked up one hundred and sixty five points about one point three percent thirteen thousand for the snp five hundred and twenty four points almost extends present finished at forty two ninety six trading twitter was suspended forbid just before the purchase of the social media platforms was as before that tears up five and two thirds present love shares worth about five percent less than muscles offer fifty four dollars and twenty cents apiece as i said the deal hammered shares of digital

she said for shareholders and that's the mature at american capitalism right maximizing shareholder value well yes and no i mean it is the mantra but how and why it came to be that way marketplaces got tongue looked into that for his back in two thousand and sixteen it all began with a professor at the university of chicago economist milton friedman wrote this in nineteen seventy there is one and only one social responsibility of business to increase it's profits for whom for stockholders he wrote this was a brand new idea that took because the old corporate model was crumbling under pressure from inflation and from weak growth records workman of the drucker institute is the author of the end of loyalty coming up this year some called it's slump flexion or in flunk was another one hundred circulated but most famously was stagflation it exposed american companies as uncompetitive many companies had gotten fat and lazy during the golden age of american business which didn't see the seem starting to come apart until the late sixties early seventies friedman any chicago colleagues or give the companies were taking on too many social responsibilities providing jobs helping to fight pollution and and discrimination it was inefficient we saw enormous amounts of waste going on economists mike johnson was a student of friedman's and he call wrote the most cited business paper ever shareholders suffered he wrote because executives were selfish they wanted perks you can't ignore the self interest of everybody that and ball in you can't assume that for homes maximize profits ceos feathering their nests now some of us have a certain vintage recall the eighties film wall street it stars or rather have noxious shareholder gordon gekko here talk and other shareholders you are all being royally screwed over by these these bureaucrats with their their state life was their hunting and fishing trips their their corporate jets the golden parachute if you listen closely gordon gekko was channeling his inner university of chicago mike jensen if you ship of executives shape up companies and shareholders when quite often something that significantly new and right or basically right is rejected by the profession because it's to new but that all went away eventually it caught off it stuck jensen went on to become a superstar profit harvard business school where his ideas
